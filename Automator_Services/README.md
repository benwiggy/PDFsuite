Here is a collection of MacOS Automator workflows, designed to be used as 'Services'. Download them, unzip them, and install into USER/Library/Services. They will then be available from the Services menu of the Finder or on a right-click when PDFs are selected.

Note that if files other than PDF documents are within the selection, the service will not appear in the menu.

***PRO TIP:*** The files are passed to the service in the order that they appear in the Finder. So re-ordering the files (e.g. ascending, descending, Name, Date modified, etc) will alter the order that they are processed. This may be useful/relevant when performing actions like Combining PDFs or Adding Index Numbers.

Some of the scripts inside the workflows have options that can be altered. Double-click on the workflow to open it in Automator, and just edit the text accordingly.

These workflows were created on MacOS Sierra (10.12). They should work on most OS versions before that, but if they are not recognized, you can 'roll your own' in Automator using the bare scripts. The instructions are in the _Automator_Scripts_ folder.
