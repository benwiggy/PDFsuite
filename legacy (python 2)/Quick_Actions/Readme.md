QUICK ACTIONS

Unzip these workflow files and save them to the {user}/Library/Services folder. If the Services folder does not exist in the Library, then you must create it.
They will then be available in the Quick Actions panel when you select a PDF. (Or an Image file, in the case of the Image to PDF workflow).
